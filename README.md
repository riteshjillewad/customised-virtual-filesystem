# 🗂️ Customised Virtual File System (CVFS)
A Linux-style in-memory virtual file system implemented in C, designed to simulate core operating system file system concepts such as inodes, file descriptors, permissions, and metadata management using custom data structures.

This project provides a command-line shell that allows users to create, manage, and manipulate virtual files entirely in RAM, closely mirroring how real file systems operate internally.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Customised Virtual File System (CVFS) is a monolithic C-based application that emulates the internal working of a UNIX/Linux file system.
It focuses on how file systems work beneath the hood, rather than on user-level APIs.

**All files, metadata, and structures exist in primary memory (RAM), allowing fast access while maintaining realistic file system behavior.**

This project is ideal for understanding:
- Operating System internals
- File system architecture
- Low-level resource management
- Data structure design in C

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Simulate a Linux-like file system environment
- Implement inode-based file management
- Manage file descriptors and permissions
- Provide a custom shell interface for interaction
- Demonstrate core OS concepts using pure C and DSA

## 🚀 Features
- **Virtual Storage:** All files and metadata are stored in primary memory (RAM), simulating a disk.
- **Command Line Interface:** Custom shell to interact with the file system.
- **File Operations:** Support for standard operations like `creat`, `open`, `read`, `write`, and `unlink`.
- **Permission Management:** UNIX-style permissions:
  - Read (1)
  - Write (2)
  - Read + Write (3)
- **Metadata Management:** `stat` and `fstat` commands to view file details (inode number, size, permissions).
- **Persistence (Backup/Restore):** Ability to save the virtual file system state to a hard disk file `(CVFS_Backup.bin) and restore it later.
- **Resource Management:** Handles up to 20 open files and a configurable number of maximum inodes.

## 🧠 Internal Architecture
CVFS is designed around classic Linux file system structures.

### 🧩 Data Structures Used

| Data Structure | Description |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **SuperBlock** | Maintains global file system metadata such as total inodes, free inodes, and file system status. |
| **Inode** | Stores file metadata including file name, inode number, file size, permissions, link count, and data buffer pointer. |
| **FileTable** | Maintains information about opened files such as read/write offsets, access mode, and reference count. |
| **UFDT (User File Descriptor Table)** | An array that maps file descriptors to their respective `FileTable` entries. |
| **DILB (Doubly Linked List)** | Maintains the Disk Inode List Block, linking all inodes in the file system. |
| **BootBlock** | Stores initial boot-time metadata and assists in file system initialization. |
| **Character Buffer** | Stores actual file data in memory (simulates disk data blocks). |

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* GCC Compiler
  * Linux/macOS: GCC
  * Windows: MinGW

### 🛠️ Build Instructions
```c
gcc main.c cvfs_helper.c -o cvfs
```

### ▶️ Run the Application
**Linux**
```
./cvfs
```
**Windows**
```
cvfs
```

## 🛠️ Makefile Build & Run Instructions
This project also includes a Makefile to automate the compilation and execution process. This ensures you can build the project quickly without typing long GCC commands manually.

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler (Installed via MinGW on Windows or standard packages on Linux/macOS)
- Make (Standard on Linux/macOS; on Windows use `mingw32-make` or the provided batch file approach)

### Available Commands
1. **Build the Project**
   Compiles the source code (`main.c` and `cvfs_helper.c`) and creates the executable `cvfs`. It only recompiles files that have changed.
   ```
                                                           make
   ```
2. **Run the Project**
   Builds the project (if necessary) and immediately launches the Virtual File System shell.
   ```
                                                           make run
   ```
3. **Clean the Project**
   Removes all generated build files `(.o objects)`, the executable, and any backup files `(CVFS_Backup.bin)`. Use this to force a fresh compilation.
   ```
                                                           make clean
   ```

**Windows Users Note**: If the make command is not recognized in your terminal, you likely need to use `mingw32-make` instead:
